Lesson Learned:
This is one of my first javascript projects, that I have made. I learned that it is essential to use easy to understand id names and adding elements like Number to ensure the value is read as a number and not a string. The use of the DOM to refer to the html and using event listeners, like click made it so the action would help carry out the function. This project was very fun since it was wonderful being able to use both css and js with this project.
